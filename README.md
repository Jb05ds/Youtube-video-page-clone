Mini YouTube & Video Page Clone

A front-end practice project where I recreated a YouTube-style homepage and video watch page using only HTML and CSS.
This project was made to improve my skills in layouts, styling, and modern CSS techniques, and to show my ability to build clean and structured web pages without relying on frameworks or JavaScript.
